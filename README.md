# SW-WCH-Arduino-Button-02


Here is simple test code to control a led with a button. I used CH32V003 board.

Demonstration:

<img width="513" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f23f1eb-4109-4644-aaea-fec8c857977b" />

(LED OFF)

<img width="561" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b16b539f-a9e7-41a0-90cc-a9a0b4ac3457" />

(LED ON)

Hope this helps you.
